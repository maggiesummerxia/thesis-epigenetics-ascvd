This repository contains analysis scripts supporting the findings from my PhD thesis on the associations between DNA methylation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, with a focus on large-scale epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), meta-analysis, and Mendelian randomisation (MR).
